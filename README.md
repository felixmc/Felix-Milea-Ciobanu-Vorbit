# Vorbit: Reddit Data Mining and Machine Learning
Vorbit is a data mining and machine learning tool for the social news website Reddit that provides its users with two major features: first, the ability to gather analytical data about user posting behavior on specific segments of Reddit; secondly, to make automated posts to Reddit using machine learning bots that learn from the gathered data.

This is my computer science Capstone project for Neumont University.
